## Hi 👋, I'm Eduardo
I turn messy data into clear, decision-ready insights. End-to-end: **ETL → model → dashboard**.

## Quick Facts
- Economics + hands-on accounting background
- Calm under pressure, fast learner, team-oriented
- Open to Junior Data/Business Analyst roles (Barcelona/Hybrid/Remote)

## Featured Projects
- **Credit Risk Scoring (300k+ loans)**  
  Logistic PD model (**AUC 0.865, KS 0.632**); export deciles to BI and define cut-offs to balance review cost vs risk.  
  Repo: [Credit Risk in Small Business](https://github.com/eduardo-fd/Small-Business-Credit-Risk). (ETL, modeling, Power BI dashboard)

- **AI & Employment in the EU (Honors Thesis)**  
  Panel model across **29 countries (644 obs.)**, **R² within 0.84**; insights on how AI adoption shifts job structure.  
  Repo: [Impact of IA adoption on the Labour Market](https://github.com/eduardo-fd/AI-Adoption-Employment-EU) (methods, reproducible notebooks, poster)

## How I Work (Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act)
- **Ask:** Clarify the business question, success metrics, and constraints.  
- **Prepare:** Audit sources, define data dictionary, set quality checks.  
- **Process:** Clean, join, and reshape (SQL/Power Query); create features.  
- **Analyze:** Explore cohorts, test hypotheses, model if needed with clear metrics.  
- **Share:** Deliver dashboards/notebooks with “so-what” insights and next steps.  
- **Act:** Recommend decisions, implement cut-offs/alerts, and track impact.

## Toolbox
SQL (joins, CTEs, windows) · Python (pandas, scikit-learn) · Power BI (DAX, Power Query) · Tableau · Econometrics · Git/GitHub

I’m looking to collaborate on data analytics and visualization projects, and connect with people to share this journey.
