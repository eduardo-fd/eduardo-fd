## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Eduardo
And I'm an economist interested in all things Python & Data Science!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on earning my Microsoft PL-300 certification to become a Microsoft Certified Power BI Data Analyst.
- ðŸŒ± I recently built an end-to-end credit risk project (SBA loans), delivering a logistic regression PD model (AUC=0.865, KS=0.632) and an executive Power BI dashboard for decision-making that you can check it out [here](https://github.com/eduardo-fd/Small-Business-Credit-Risk).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data analytics and visualization projects, and connect with people to share this journey.
  - ðŸ’¬ Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn and reach out anytime!
